# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Robert, a seasoned software engineer based in Atlanta, GA. My journey has been filled with diverse experiences, from developing robust APIs and architecting scalable database solutions to leading teams towards technical excellence.

Currently, I am contributing my skills at a renowned tech firm in Atlanta, where I've had the opportunity to work on a plethora of projects, each with its own set of exciting challenges. My dedication to the craft was recognized when I was honored with technical achievement awards in consecutive years.

Previously, I've had the privilege to work with amazing teams at various innovative companies, where we made significant strides, optimizations, and improvments to user experiences.

My academic foundation was laid at reputable institutions where I delved into the intricacies of Computer Science. I also had a brief yet enriching venture studying abroad which broadened my perspective immensely.

Outside the tech world, I'm an avid soccer coach, nurturing the next generation of soccer enthusiasts. I also had a stint as a teaching assistant, which allowed me to share my knowledge and passion for learning with others.

I invite you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-jack/) or explore my projects right here on [GitHub](https://github.com/roboojack). Let's collaborate and create something amazing!
